 Project Idea: Local Food Explorer
A full-stack web application that allows users to explore regional food specialties based on their location or entered city name. It displays popular local dishes with images, descriptions, and origins, helping food lovers and travelers discover culinary highlights.

 Tech Stack
 Frontend (React)
React.js – Component-based UI

React Router DOM – Routing between pages (Home, Login, Explore, Admin)

Axios – API requests

Tailwind CSS / Bootstrap – Responsive styling

React Hook Form – Easy form handling

Context API / Redux (Optional) – For state management (auth, user, etc.)

🌐 Backend (Node.js + Express)
Node.js – Runtime environment

Express.js – Server and API routing

Multer – Handling image uploads

bcryptjs – Password hashing

jsonwebtoken (JWT) – Authentication tokens

dotenv – Environment variable management

CORS – Cross-origin requests

💾 Database (MongoDB Atlas)
MongoDB Atlas – Cloud NoSQL database

Mongoose – ODM for MongoDB (schema definition, data modeling)

📦Deployment
Git + GitHub – Version control

Render / Railway / Vercel / Netlify – Deployment platforms

Postman – API testing

MongoDB Compass – GUI for checking data

🌟 Key Functionalities
🔍 1. Food Discovery
Input city name or auto-detect using browser geolocation API

Fetch dishes related to that region

Display food cards with:

Image

Name

Region

Description

🔐 2. Authentication
Admin signup/login

Passwords hashed using bcrypt

JWT stored in localStorage for session

🛠 3. Admin Panel
Admin can Add / Edit / Delete dishes

Use protected routes for admin pages

Admin can upload images of foods

📷 4. Image Uploads
Users/admins can upload food images (stored on server or cloud like Cloudinary)

Display them in frontend UI

📡 5. API Endpoints (CRUD)
Method	Endpoint	Purpose
GET	/foods	Get all foods
GET	/foods/:city	Get foods for a city
POST	/foods	Add new food (admin only)
PUT	/foods/:id	Edit food (admin only)
DELETE	/foods/:id	Delete food (admin only)
POST	/auth/signup	Admin signup
POST	/auth/login	Admin login

🗓 Day-by-Day Plan 
Day	Task	Deliverable
1	Create GitHub repo, README, React app scaffold	GitHub + create-react-app or Vite
2	Build city input UI + mock data fetch	Input box + static food data
3	Design and show food cards	Use map to render sample foods
4	Setup Express server	Basic server + /foods endpoint
5	Connect React to Express	Axios call from frontend to backend
6	MongoDB schema + DB connection	mongoose.connect, Food model
7	Build CRUD API	REST endpoints, test with Postman
8	Implement JWT-based Auth	Signup, Login, route protection
9	Add file upload (Multer)	Upload images + serve from backend
10	Deploy backend (Render/Railway)	Hosted API URL
11	Deploy frontend (Vercel/Netlify)	Live web app
12	Polish UI	Mobile responsiveness, error messages
13	Write API tests	Jest or Postman collection tests
14	Final demo	Record video, update README, submit
